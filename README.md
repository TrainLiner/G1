# G1

This is a rpg game im making and its not even close to be finishing, ive just finished the character setup. 
The only reason why I'm putting this up on github is to get critism and to HOPEFULLY learn to code C++ with good practices

NOTE: There are things that I'm aware are probably STUPID. like the charactersetup() function, but it works so im struggling to find reasons to change it and it's hard for me to imagine any issues I MIGHT run into later.
